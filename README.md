**Visualizing Circuit Behavior on RISC-V FPGA**

Full-featured, VGA-rendered implementation of a logic circuit simulator, created on an FPGA platform (DE1-SoC) using C. This project supports real-time hardware interaction through PS/2 keyboard input and full circuit simulation built entirely from NAND gate logics. Users can draw gates and wires, toggle inputs, and save or reuse custom components â€” all from the keyboard, with visual feedback rendered directly on-screen.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- **VGA-Rendered Logic UI**  
  Visually interactive grid-based circuit layout rendered in 640x480 VGA.

- **Keyboard-Only Interaction**  
  Use WASD to move, ENTER to draw, and number/letter keys to switch modes and toggle inputs.

- **NAND-Only Foundation**  
  All logic is based on NAND gates; users can build AND, OR, XOR, etc. from NAND.

- **Custom Gate Saving & Reuse**  
  Save circuits into reusable custom components (via keys Gâ€“L) and place them later (keys 6â€“0).

- **Up to 3 Inputs/Outputs Per Gate**  
  Simplified gate design to support manageable simulation and truth table resolution.

- **Real-Time Signal Propagation**  
  Wires update dynamically as inputs are toggled, with color-coded rendering of logic states.
